## How to host my portfolio website on GihHub?

This is a reminder for me (and anyone if needed) to remember what did I do to put my files on GitHub pages. 

## Configuration on GitHub

1) **Step 1**: The repository I want to host as a website has the following structure:
```
[Name of the repo]/
├── docs/
    ├── index.html
    ├── style.css
    ├── javascript.js

    ├── assets/
        ├── image1.png
        ├── image2.jpeg
```

2) **Step 2**: Go to Setting>Pages and set like that:

| Source | Deploy from a branch |
|--------|----------------------|
| Branch | main /docs           |


3) **Step 3**: Refresh and the link should appeared in Settings>Pages <br>
  Typically, the link should look like  https://username.github.io/repo_name/
